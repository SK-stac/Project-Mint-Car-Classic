# Project-Mint-Car-Classic

Mint Classics Company, a retailer of classic model cars and other vehicles, is looking to close one of its storage facilities. 
To make a data-based business decision, the company wants suggestions and recommendations for reorganizing or reducing inventory while maintaining timely customer service. 
As a data analyst, you will use MySQL Workbench to familiarize yourself with the general business by examining the current data and isolating and identifying those parts of the data that could be useful in deciding how to reduce inventory.
